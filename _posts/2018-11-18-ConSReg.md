## Introduction
Recent advances in genomic technologies have generated large-scale protein-DNA interaction data and open chromatic regions for multiple plant species. To predict condition-specific gene regulatory networks using these data, we developed the **Con**dition **S**pecific **Reg**ulatory network inference engine (**ConSReg**), which combines heterogeneous genomic data using sparse linear model followed by feature selection and stability selection to select key regulatory genes. ConsReg was developed as a Python package. The process of integrating genomic data and inferring regulatory networks is summarized in the flowchart below.
