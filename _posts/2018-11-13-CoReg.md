## Introduction
CoReg is a computational tool for identifying co-regulatory genes in large-scale networks. We provide CoReg as an R package, which can be applied in any organisms with genome-scale regulatory network data.

## Publication
CoReg was published in **BMC Systems Biology**. Please cite the following paper if CoReg is used in your publication:\
