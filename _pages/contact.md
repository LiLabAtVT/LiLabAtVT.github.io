## Available Positions

**Graduate student in plant disease detection using machine learning and metagenomics.**

A graduate research associate position is available starting Spring 2023. The project is to analyze nanopore sequencing data from plant pathogens for culture-free pathogen detection. Prior experiment in Python programming is required. Interested students can apply through the TPS program or GBCB program at Virginia Tech. Students seeking master's degree from computer science or other programs with experience in developing machine learning models are welcome to apply.

**Graduate student in plant molecular biology, imaging and machine learning.**

A graduate research associate position is available starting in Spring 2023. The project is to develop a 3D model of plant roots and use machine learning methods to embed single-cell sequencing data into 3D models. Prefered qualifications: (1) experience in confocal imaging. (2) molecular biology experiments such a gene cloning and PCR. (3) Python or R programming and use of the Linux operating system. Interested students can apply through [[SPES]](https://spes.vt.edu/) or [[GBCB]](https://gbcb.graduateschool.vt.edu/about.html) program at Virginia Tech.

**Undergraduate**
We are seeking eager students that would like acquire coding experience in a wide-range of computational project such as deep learning networks, computer vision, edge computing, mobile computing, drone image analysis, and genomics and bioinformatics at single cell level. 

Interested applicants should [[**contact Dr. Li**]](https://spes.vt.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/li-song.html) or [[**Dr. Bargmann**]](https://spes.vt.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/bargmann-bastiaan.html)
