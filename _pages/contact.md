## Available Positions

**Graduate student in plant disease detection using machine learning and metagenomics.**

A graduate research associate position is available starting Spring 2023. The project is to analyze nanopore sequencing data from plant pathogens for culture-free pathogen detection. Prior experiment in Python programming is required. Interested students can apply through the TPS program or GBCB program at Virginia Tech.  

**Graduate student in plant molecular biology, imaging and machine learning.**

A graduate research associate position is available starting in Spring 2023. The project is to develop a 3D model of plant roots and use machine learning methods to embed single-cell sequencing data into 3D models. Experience in confocal imaging and molecular biology is required. Skills in python or R programming and the Linux operating system are preferred. Interested students can apply through the TPS program or GBCB program at Virginia Tech.

**Undergraduate**
We are seeking eager students that would like acquire coding experience in a wide-range of computational project such as deep learning networks, computer vision, edge computing, mobile computing, drone image analysis, and genomics and bioinformatics at single cell level. 

Interested applicants should [[**contact Dr. Li**]](https://spes.vt.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/li-song.html) or [[**Dr. Bargmann**]] (https://spes.vt.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/bargmann-bastiaan.html)
