## Available Positions
**Postdoctoral**
A postdoctoral position is available starting spring 2021. The project is to study gene regulation at single cell level in plant roots. We are using both Arabidopsis and related Brassicaceae species as our model system to characterize stress response genes in roots. Required qualifications: the applicant should have strong background in bioinformatics/computational biology; Familiar with Linux command line environment. Must have programing experience in R or python. Knowledge of developing deep learning models using tensorflow or machine learning using scikit-learn is preferred. 

**Graduate**
A graduate research association position is available starting Spring 2021. The project is to develop machine learning models and perform experimental analysis for plant diseases. This project will involve using robotic systems to automatically sample plant leaves and testing the presence of pathogen using nanopore sequencing. Interested students can apply through the TPS program or GBCB program at Virginia Tech. 

**Undergraduate**
We are seeking eager students that would like acquire coding experience in a wide-range of computational project such as deep learning networks, computer vision, edge computing, drone image analysis, and genomics and bioinformatics at single cell level.
